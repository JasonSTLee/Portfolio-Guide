- Python Related Projects
- SQL & Tableau Projects
  
I split between Python and SQL & Tableau projects because on Python I extracted, cleaned, analyzed and visualized the data all within each project's notebook (on VS Code). On the other hand SQL was used for everything in the data process but graphing; that's where I used Tableau for the visuals.
